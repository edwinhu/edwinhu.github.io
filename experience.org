- I study the economic implications of rulemaking on financial markets.
  - I conducted [[https://ssrn.com/abstract=3195001][independent research]] suggesting that 'speed bumps' may improve
    market quality, (see coverage in [[https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-speed-bumps-help-protect-ordinary-investors-1528974002][Wall Street Journal]]).
  - I conducted [[https://www.sec.gov/files/bats_moc_analysis.pdf][independent research]] suggesting that fragmentation of closing
    auction liquidity is not related to in-efficient price discovery,
    contrary to claims by incumbent exchanges.
- I am involved in modernizing the Commission's technology infrastructure
  through data science and cloud-computing initiatives.
  - I led the development of the DERA Open Source Analytics Server (~R/Python~
    Jupyter Notebook environment with custom environment support).
- I coordinate with SROs to acquire and construct regulatory datasets.
  - FINRA off-exchange trade executions reported to the Trade Reporting
    Facilities.
