* Loan Syndication Networks
/with Ioannis Spyridiopoulos/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We document a positive relationship between lender network centrality and the
ability to offer competitive bids in syndicated lending markets. Better
connected lenders are more likely to syndicate loans as lead arrangers, and
provide lower costs of borrowing. We exploit exogenous variation in network
structure resulting from bank mergers to provide evidence that greater
connectivity reduces firms' costs of borrowing. The effects are larger for
borrowers with higher levels of information asymmetry---consistent with recent
theory suggesting that superior networking facilitates information sharing and
coordination.

This paper exploits cross-sectional variation in trading activity and the
staggered securities phase-in when the Investors Exchange (IEX) becomes a
national securities exchange to study the effects of intentional access delays
on market quality and price discovery. Market quality improves after IEX becomes
an exchange for securities with high historical IEX market share. Price
discovery improves overall, although IEX's contribution to price discovery
remains small. Intermarket Sweep Order activity decreases overall, coinciding
with improvements in price discovery. In a second natural experiment where IEX's
ECN goes dark in 28 symbols there is no change in market quality or price
discovery. The findings in this paper suggest that protected markets with
symmetric speed bumps may be a feasible solution to deemphasize speed in lieu of
regulatory intervention.

We show that the PIN model is no more useful in identifying private-information
arrival than simply looking at whether turnover is above average or not. This
calls into question PIN as a measure of private information since turnover
varies for many reasons unrelated to private-information arrival. We also
examine an alternative to the PIN model, the Odders-White and Ready (2008)
model. Our tests indicate that measures of private information based on the
Odders-White and Ready (2008) model are promising alternatives to PIN.

We document a positive effect of financial integration on economic growth. Using
US state-by-state financial deregulations, we find that economic growth occurred
in states where bank deregulation solved a capital immobility problem. We use a
matching method that constructs synthetic counterfactual states to identify the
channels that link bank deregulation to financial integration, and thereby to
economic growth. Our results reveal a correlation between financial integration
and subsequent banking sector changes including improved bank efficiency, better
lending and borrowing rates, and an expansion in loan recipients. We show that
financial integration democratizes lending and spurs economic growth.
