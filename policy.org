As Counsel to Commissioner Robert J. Jackson, Jr. and Financial Economist in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (2016--2020), I conducted original research informing Commission policy on market structure, financial intermediation, and corporate governance. I also worked on policy issues including [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-050319][M&A disclosures]], [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/jackson-statement-margin-security-futures][margin requirements for security futures]], [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-lee-082719][human capital disclosures]], [[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2018/33-10593.pdf][executive hedging disclosures]], the [[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2018/34-84875.pdf][Transaction Fee Pilot]], and the [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-091919][Volcker Rule]].

My research showed that [[https://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/working-papers/07feb18_hu_iex_becoming_an_exchange][slowing down trading reduced costs for investors]], contributing to the Commission's evaluation of exchange speed bumps. I led the [[https://www.sec.gov/files/bats_moc_analysis.pdf][first SEC economic analysis]] to use regulatory audit trail data, showing that off-exchange trading at the close had not harmed price discovery---leading NYSE to cut its top-tier closing auction fees by two-thirds. I also provided [[https://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/white-papers/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality][evidence that widening tick sizes deteriorated market quality]], findings later cited in [[https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba16-wstate-piwowarm-20220330.pdf][Congressional testimony]].

On financial intermediation, my research informed Commissioner Jackson's [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-060519-iabd][dissent on Regulation Best Interest]], showing that advisors not subject to a fiduciary standard were more likely to give conflicted advice. I produced evidence that [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-2019-12-18-accredited-investor][private placement brokers]] have unusually high misconduct rates, and that [[https://www.sec.gov/files/jackson-maloney-response-letter-111819-signed.pdf][large fund managers]] overwhelmingly vote against political spending disclosure despite lacking clear guidelines.

On corporate governance, my work supported the Commissioner's [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-2019-11-05-open-meeting][challenge to proposed restrictions]] on shareholder proposals, and his [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/jackson-statement-proposed-amendments-accelerated-filer-definition][opposition to rolling back]] Sarbanes-Oxley auditor attestation requirements. Research on [[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-jackson-061118][executive selling into stock buybacks]] informed legislation proposed by Senator Baldwin and a [[https://www.sec.gov/files/jackson-letter-030619.pdf][letter to Congress]] showing long-run underperformance.
