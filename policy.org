Professor Hu served as Counsel to SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson, Jr. and as a Financial Economist in the Commission's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (2016--2020), conducting original research on market structure, financial intermediation, and corporate governance.

His research showed that [[https://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/working-papers/07feb18_hu_iex_becoming_an_exchange][slowing down trading reduced costs for investors]], contributing to the Commission's evaluation of exchange speed bumps. He led the [[https://www.sec.gov/files/bats_moc_analysis.pdf][first SEC economic analysis]] to use regulatory audit trail data, finding that off-exchange trading at the close had not harmed price discovery---a result that led NYSE to cut its top-tier closing auction fees by two-thirds. Separate [[https://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/white-papers/dera_wp_tick_size-market_quality][evidence on tick size changes and market quality]] was later cited in [[https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba16-wstate-piwowarm-20220330.pdf][Congressional testimony]].

Professor Hu's research on financial intermediation informed Commissioner Jackson's [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-060519-iabd][dissent on Regulation Best Interest]], showing that advisors not subject to a fiduciary standard were more likely to give conflicted advice. His evidence that [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-2019-12-18-accredited-investor][private placement brokers]] have unusually high misconduct rates supported the Commissioner's dissent on expanding private markets to retail investors.

On corporate governance, Professor Hu challenged [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-jackson-2019-11-05-open-meeting][proposed restrictions on shareholder proposals]] and opposed the [[https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/jackson-statement-proposed-amendments-accelerated-filer-definition][rollback of Sarbanes-Oxley auditor attestation requirements]]. A [[https://www.sec.gov/files/jackson-maloney-response-letter-111819-signed.pdf][letter to Congress]] revealed that large fund managers overwhelmingly vote against political spending disclosure despite lacking clear guidelines. His research on [[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-jackson-061118][executive selling into stock buybacks]] showed long-run underperformance, informing [[https://www.sec.gov/files/jackson-letter-030619.pdf][a letter to Senator Van Hollen]] and legislation proposed by Senator Baldwin.
