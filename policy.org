- First SEC economic analysis to use regulatory audit trail and TRF data.
- Led to NYSE cutting its top tier MOC fees by two-thirds. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We analyze the correlation among closing price discovery and closing price
efficiency–-two established metrics from the academic finance literature–-with
off-exchange trading activity at the close. We analyze equity securities trading
and quotation data during the first quarter of 2017 to determine the amount of
closing auction volume, the amount of off-exchange Market-on-Close (MOC)
activity, and estimates of closing price discovery and efficiency.
