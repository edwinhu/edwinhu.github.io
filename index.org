*** [[./docs/idc.pdf][Information Diffusion in Institutional Investor Networks]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This paper tests whether institutional investors share valuable information with one another through information networks. I develop a new measure, "Information Diffusion Centrality," based on a stylized model of bilateral information exchange. The model predicts that central investors have superior access to information because they are on the paths of many random walks. Consistent with this prediction, I show that the interim trading performance of central investors is 60% higher than that of the average investor. Furthermore, central investors' round-trip trading performance in target stock around merger announcements is more than two times higher than that of the average investor, even controlling for connections to merger advisors. In contrast, centrality plays no role in trading performance around sudden board director and key manager deaths. Overall, my findings suggest that network information diffusion plays an important role in informed trading.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Some recent papers suggest that the Easley and O'Hara (1987) probability of informed trade (PIN) model fails to capture private information. We investigate this issue by comparing the PIN model with the Duarte and Young (2009) (DY) and Odders-White and Ready (2008) (OWR) models of private information arrival. We find that the PIN and DY models fail to capture private information because they mistakenly associate variations in turnover with the arrival of private information. On the other hand, the OWR model, which uses returns along with order flow imbalance to identify informed trade, seems to produce patterns that are consistent with the arrival of private information.

/with Elizabeth Berger, Alexander Butler, and Morad Zekhnini/
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We document substantial variation in the effect of state-level bank branching deregulation in the United States on economic growth. We examine the sources of this variation by testing multiple channels that may link deregulation and economic growth. Using a matching method that utilizes synthetic counterfactual states, we find support for the hypothesis that economic growth was associated with states where deregulation solved a capital immobility or "dammed" credit problem. We do not find support for other channels, which posit that banks became more efficient, financed more innovative businesses, or learned by observing prior deregulations.
