My current research is focused on market structure issues including
competition between financial institutions---e.g., banks and
exchanges---and the effects on market quality. My policy work is
focused on identifying gaps in securities laws, which often intersect
with issues in corporate and fiduciary law, and developing solutions
to the resulting agency problems.
